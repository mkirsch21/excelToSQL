# excelToSQL
My company currently uses an excel sheet of database tables to provide the client with a scope of what is in the database as well as document new data that needs to be inserted into the tables. I am creating this so that when we are given requirements to add data to tables, we can populate the excel sheets and then run a python script that will automatically generate a sql script with the necessary data as well as create the wrappers of the script so that we can then use our dropbox system which automatically attaches the script to TFS for our migration purposes.
