run it like this:
python3 /home/pi/Documents/Python/excelToSqlProject/excelToSQL.py rpeTables r_account_type MD101.001 EI

or :
python3 /home/pi/Documents/Python/excelToSqlProject/excelToSQL.py rpeTables r_account_subtype MD101.002 EI

This is how I run it on my raspberry pi. Yours will differ depending on the file location of the script/documents.
Put all the documents in the same folder. The first parameter is the python script, second = name of the excel doc, third = name of the excel sheet within the excel doc, fourth = name of the sql script you that it will print out, fifth = functional area of the script it is writing to.
